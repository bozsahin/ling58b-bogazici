## *NEW COURSE PROPOSAL (Boğaziçi Linguistics)*

1.  COURSE CODE, TITLE AND CREDIT:

    Ling58B: Linguistic Categories and Grammar

2.  CATALOG DESCRIPTION: Referentiality and configurationality in
    linguistic theories. Linguistic categories. Structural functions of
    case, agreement and grammatical relations. Intensional categories:
    decision versus choice. The verb\'s unique role in grammar. Sources
    and limits of human language categorial variation. Case studies with
    typologically diverse relatively understudied languages.

3.  FACULTY MEMBERS WHO CAN TEACH THE COURSE: Prof.dr. Cem Bozşahin

4.  BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT(S): A first course in at least three of the
    following topics including syntax, either at the graduate level or
    undergraduate: morphology, syntax, semantics, phonology, typology,
    computer science. Seniors in Linguistics can take it as elective.
    Mathematical preliminaries (lambda-calculus, monads, computation)
    are covered in class. Knowledge of programming is a plus, but not
    required.

5.  COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAMS: This course is intended as a
    graduate level elective in Linguistics, for MA and PhD students. It
    can also be taken by senior students of lingustics and by students
    of other departments who have sufficient interest and background.

6.  COURSE OBJECTIVES: To build knowledge of putting syntax-semantics of
    referentiality and configurationality together in a grammar. To
    assess similar descriptions. To understand the relation between
    choice and decision in a category. To analyze a language hitherto
    underanalyzed from the presented perspective. To assess different
    categorization of distinct verb forms.

7.  COURSE OUTLINE: The course consists of four parts in one term. In
    the first part, we build on categorial and generative solutions to
    configurationality, and study referentiality and its categoriality.
    In the second part, the degrees of freedom in a theory are assessed
    from languages which are theoretically challenging and typologically
    diverse. In the third part, students assess two categorially
    underanalyzed languages from the perspective covered in class. In
    the final part, they present their analyses of the two languages,
    and critique each others\' work.

10. COURSE CONDUCT: First two parts of the course outline are formal
    lectures by the instructor. In the third part, students form two
    groups to study in class two languages chosen by them from a pool.
    They present the typological description of the languages to
    classmates. In the fourth part, the groups present their analyses of
    a particular phenomenon in these languages, discussed and assessed
    by everyone in class. A computational tool is explored throughout
    the class for developing and assessing linguistic analyses.

11. GRADING: a) Five weekly essays, either in class or take-home. b)
    Group presentation of language description in the third part. c)
    Group presentation of preliminary analyses in the fourth part. d)
    Personal Term report as final exam. e) Participation in discussions.

    All equal weight.

12. EFFECTIVE DATE: September-October 2024.

13. FREQUENCY: On demand.
